“How much statistics do I need to know to become a Data Scientist?”

This is one of the most common questions I get asked.

Here are the 20 Statistics concepts you need to know 👇

- Permutations & combinations
- Card and die roll problem-solving
- Bayes’ Theorem & conditional probability

→ What's the probability of drawing two aces in a row from a standard deck, without replacing the first card?
→ A spam filter is 95% accurate on spam and 98% accurate on real emails. If 30% of emails are spam, what’s the probability this flagged email is spam? 
→ How many unique 5-letter passwords can you create using only the letters in "STATISTICS" where letters can be repeated?

- Mean, median, mode
- Standard deviation and variance
- Bernoulli’s, Binomial, Normal, Uniform, Exponential distributions

→ When would you choose to use median over mean as a measure of central tendency in a dataset?
→ Given a dataset with variance 16, if each value is multiplied by 3, what is the new variance and standard deviation?
→ A fair coin is flipped 8 times. What’s the probability of getting exactly 6 heads? Set up the calculation
→ If customers arrive at a store following exponential distribution with mean 10 minutes, what's the probability of waiting over 20 minutes?

𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀
- Type 1 & 2 errors
- A/B experimentation
- Central Limit Theorem
- Sampling techniques & biases
- Confidence intervals & p-values
- T-test, Z-test, Chi-squared tests
- Basic causal inference techniques

P͟r͟a͟c͟t͟i͟c͟e͟ ͟i͟n͟t͟e͟r͟v͟i͟e͟w͟ ͟q͟u͟e͟s͟t͟i͟o͟n͟s͟

→ A spam filter marks legitimate emails as spam. Is this a Type 1 or Type 2 error, and which is more costly?
→ You ran a survey that only captures responses from LinkedIn users who actively comment. What sampling bias is present and how might it affect results?
→ A spam filter marks legitimate emails as spam. Is this a Type1 or Type2 error and which is more costly?
→ Your marketing partners wants to test 5 email subject lines simultaneously. What issues might arise compared to a simple A/B test?
→ In an A/B experiment, what are the factors that affect the size of a confidence interval?
→ Explain how instrumental variables can help establish causality when direct experimentation isn’t possible
→ A food delivery app ants to measure if their new recommendation algorithm actually causes increased order frequency. They can’t run a pure A/B test because user behaviors varies heavily by location, income level and past ordering patterns. What causal inference technique would be most appropriate and why?

𝗠𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴
- Decision trees
- Clustering models
- Feature engineering
- Time series analyses
- Feature selection methods
- Logistic & Linear regression
- Model testing and validation

P͟r͟a͟c͟t͟i͟c͟e͟ ͟i͟n͟t͟e͟r͟v͟i͟e͟w͟ ͟q͟u͟e͟s͟t͟i͟o͟n͟s͟

→ What are the main assumptions of a linear regression model?
→ What metrics would you use to evaluate the results of a classification model?
→ You have timestamps in your dataset. Beyond extracting hour/day/month, what creative feature engineering could reveal hidden patterns in user behavior?
→ A retail company wants to predict customer churn, but 95% of their customers don’t churn. Their logistic regression model predicts “no churn” for everyone. What could be wrong with this model? What steps would you like to fix this?
→ You’re clustering customer segments, but adding more features makes your clusters less meaningful. Some features are highly correlated. How would you address this?
→ What are the implications of strong seasonality in your data and how does it affect your choice between ARIMA and SARIMA models?
