Once you finish clustering data using k-Means - how would you make these clusters interpretable to business stakeholders?


A few standard steps to consider are - 

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀
For each cluster, create a detailed profile by analyzing the central characteristics of the data points in that cluster.
For numerical variables, calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
For categorical variables, calculate the mode (most frequent category) and the distribution of categories within the cluster. Example:
Cluster A: Predominantly younger customers (average age 25-30), mostly single, prefer budget products.
Cluster B: Middle-aged professionals, prefer premium products, high engagement on the mobile app.

𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗚𝗼𝗮𝗹𝘀
Connect each cluster to relevant business KPIs (e.g., customer lifetime value, churn rate, average transaction value). Example: 
If a cluster has a high customer churn rate, it could be an opportunity for targeted retention efforts.

𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗘𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿
To ensure the clusters are actionable, propose specific actions for each group based on their characteristics. Example - promotions for customers likely to churn (think Xfinity)

This is but on way framework to convert clustering results to relevant insights for business. Communication with stakeholders and iterating on feedback is key.
