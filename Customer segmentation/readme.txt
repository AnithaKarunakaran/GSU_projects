Once you finish clustering data using k-Means - how would you make these clusters interpretable to business stakeholders?


A few standard steps to consider are - 

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀
For each cluster, create a detailed profile by analyzing the central characteristics of the data points in that cluster.
For numerical variables, calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
For categorical variables, calculate the mode (most frequent category) and the distribution of categories within the cluster. Example:
Cluster A: Predominantly younger customers (average age 25-30), mostly single, prefer budget products.
Cluster B: Middle-aged professionals, prefer premium products, high engagement on the mobile app.

𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗕𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗚𝗼𝗮𝗹𝘀
Connect each cluster to relevant business KPIs (e.g., customer lifetime value, churn rate, average transaction value). Example: 
If a cluster has a high customer churn rate, it could be an opportunity for targeted retention efforts.

𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗘𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿
To ensure the clusters are actionable, propose specific actions for each group based on their characteristics. Example - promotions for customers likely to churn (think Xfinity)

This is but on way framework to convert clustering results to relevant insights for business. Communication with stakeholders and iterating on feedback is key.

k-Means is designed to work with continuous numerical data. How would you adapt k-Means to handle a dataset that contains both numerical and categorical variables?

𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗶𝘅𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗠𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲
You can extend k-Means by modifying the distance measure to handle both categorical and numerical variables, for example 𝗚𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿'𝘀 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲. This is a popular metric for mixed data types. It calculates the distance for numerical variables using normalized Manhattan or Euclidean distance, while for categorical variables, it assigns a distance of 0 for identical values and 1 for different values.

K-Prototypes is an extension of k-Means specifically designed to handle mixed data types. It works as follows - 
- It uses the Euclidean distance for numerical variables and a similarity measure (such as the simple matching coefficient) for categorical variables.
- The algorithm minimizes a cost function that combines both types of variables and iteratively assigns data points to clusters.
- It allows clusters to have prototypes (centroids) that are a mix of mean values for numerical attributes and the most frequent values for categorical attributes.

Instead of adapting k-Means, you could use alternative clustering algorithms and distance metrics that are suitable for mixed data types - 
K-Medoids: Similar to k-Means, but it selects actual data points (medoids) as cluster centers, and it can use Gower's distance for mixed data.
Hierarchical Clustering: It supports various distance measures, including Gower's, and can be used for both categorical and numerical data.
